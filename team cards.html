        <center> <h1>INDIA'S TOP THREE MUSIC DIRECTORS</h1><center> 
         <p>Music is the soul of cinema. Music gives the movie a feel and emotion, and the music itself is a story to tell. We often forget about the contribution of music to cinema. We canâ€™t imagine a single movie without music. Either through songs or background music, music is part of cinema itself. A music director is as essential as a Director in making a film. South India has got some of the best talent in the world. These music directors connected to the world through their music and stole the hearts of moviegoers and musicophiles all around the globe.</p>
